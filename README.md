#### I am *Focus*, a newbie developer from 🇨🇳. 我是惶心，来自中国的萌新开发者。

🌴 I focus on making life easier; <i>that's why I contributed to develop two personal-led open source project right below: **[merger](https://github.com/hifocus/merger)** and **[get](https://github.com/hifocus/get)** </i>.  
🏃‍♂️ I run a **personal blog** in [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese), *mostly ⚙️ techy stuff, with a bit of personal Chinese creative writing. It's [www.justhx.com](https://www.justhx.com)*.  
💓 In real life, I enjoy 📸 **photography**, 🎧 listening to **music** that has 😯 stunning lyrics, ⌨️ video **content-creating**, ✒️ **Chinese-writing** and of course 🖥️ simple **coding**.  
  
📞 Feel free to contact me through 📧 **email** or any other published contact methods if you have any concerns on anything involves me. Typical response time ⏳ is **24** hours.
